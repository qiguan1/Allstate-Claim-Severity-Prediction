# Allstate-Claim-Severity-Prediction

In this project, we developed models to help Allstate automate the process of predicting claims severity by using its dataset posted on Kaggle. We explored four machine learning algorithms and developed six models to predict the claim severity (the loss value): An Ordinary Linear Regression (OLS) model, a log-linear model, a Lasso Regression model, a Ridge Regression model, and two XGBoost models with different sets of parameters. The XGBoost models yielded the best performance. Our final model, which used XGBRegressor, gave the best performance out of the six models. The final public score was fairly close to the top-ranking score in the Kaggle competition leaderboard. Using the optimized prediction model with the most useful features, Allstate can accurately predict the severity of a claim and improve the claim services it provides to the customers.
